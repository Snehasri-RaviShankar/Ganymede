        <h2>Introduction<br></h2>
        <h3 class="sub-heading" style="text-align: left; width: 100%;">Ganymede was discovered by Galileo Galilei on
          January 7, 1610, during his
          observations of Jupiter's moons. He
          discovered Ganymede, along with three other large moons of Jupiter - Io, Europa, and Callisto - which are now
          known as the Galilean moons.
          This discovery was revolutionary at the time, as it provided evidence that not everything orbited the Earth,
          contributing to the heliocentric model of the solar system. It should however be noted that due to its size
          that Ganymede was probably seen by many ancient people with greater than average light perception, (NASA,
          n.d.)
          Historically, Ganymede, the largest moon of Jupiter, was assumed to be cold and uninhabitable due to its icy
          surface. However, a change in perspective began in the late 20th century with the construction of the Galileo
          satellite mission from 1995 - 2003. As a result of the spacecraft’s observation it revealed the breathtaking
          discovery that Ganymede possesses a magnetic field, indicating a differentiated internal structure, which
          might be formed of liquid iron core or iron-sulfide. Galileo provided evidence suggesting the existence of an
          ocean underneath its crust, potentially composing salty liquid water. This finding placed Ganymede as a
          potential candidate for hosting microbial life, similar to other icy moons (Bunce, E., 2022)
          <br></br>
          Further studies and research conducted on Ganymede in 2015 by the Hubble Space Telescope, detected changes in
          Ganymedes auroras. The shifting of the auroras, influenced by Jupiter’s magnetic field, suggested the presence
          of conductive, saltwater beneath Ganymede's surface. (Hubble Space Telescope Observation, 2015)
          Now in the 2010s, interest in icy moon explorations started to mount, most notably in NASA's "Ocean Worlds"
          program. Bodies such as Ganymede stood a good chance of being the most favored targets for astrobiological
          investigations. The following missions include the ESA's JUICE mission, launched in 2023 and projected to
          reach
          its destination by 2031, which aims to conduct additional studies on the ice shell, surface, and magnetic
          field of Ganymede in assessing its life-habitation potential. Meanwhile, NASA's Europa Clipper mission may
          primarily target Europa, but information gathered in the mission will contribute further to the knowledge of
          the habitability of icy moons, perhaps providing more context regarding Ganymede's propensity to host life
          (Overview - JUICE - Cosmos. 2016).

              <h3 class="sub-heading" style="text-align: left; width: 100%;">Historically, Ganymede, the largest moon of
                Jupiter, was
                assumed to be cold and uninhabitable due to its icy surface. However, a change in perspective began in
                the
                late 20th century with the construction of the Galileo satellite mission from 1995 - 2003. As a result
                of
                the spacecraft's observation it revealed the breathtaking discovery that Ganymede possesses a magnetic
                field, indicating a differentiated internal structure, which might be formed of liquid iron core or
                iron-sulfide. Galileo provided evidence suggesting the existence of an ocean underneath its crust,
                potentially composing salty liquid water. This finding placed Ganymede as a potential candidate for
                hosting microbial life, similar to other icy moons (Bunce, E., 2022) <br></br>

                Further studies and research conducted on Ganymede in 2015 by the Hubble Space Telescope, detected
                changes
                in Ganymedes auroras. The shifting of the auroras, influenced by Jupiter's magnetic field, suggested the
                presence of conductive, saltwater beneath Ganymede's surface. (Hubble Space Telescope Observation, 2015)
                Now in the 2010s, interest in icy moon explorations started to mount, most notably in NASA's "Ocean
                Worlds" program. Bodies such as Ganymede stood a good chance of being the most favored targets for
                astrobiological investigations.The following missions include the ESA's JUICE mission, launched in 2023
                and projected to reach its destination by 2031, which aims to conduct additional studies on the ice
                shell,
                surface, and magnetic field of Ganymede in assessing its life-habitation potential. Meanwhile, NASA's
                Europa Clipper mission may primarily target Europa, but information gathered in the mission will
                contribute further to the knowledge of the habitability of icy moons, perhaps providing more context
                regarding Ganymede's propensity to host life (Overview - JUICE - Cosmos. 2016). <br></br>

                The surface of Ganymede receives approximately 0.08 sieverts per day of radiation exposure, which is an
                enormous dose compared to earth, which receives only 0.0014 sieverts per day. Ringwald, F. (2000) This
                radiation exposure would induce acute radiation sickness in only 25 days. Arnautou, P (2024) However,
                extremophiles such as the tardigrade can survive up to 10 sieverts before being rendered sterile
                Horikawa,
                D. et al (2006), which is equivalent to 125 days. Given the mating frequency of tardigrades being 50
                days
                Bingemer J. et al (2016), a self-sustaining colony of tardigrades could theoretically live and mate on
                the
                surface of Ganymede from a radiation perspective. However, it must be noted that at the temperatures
                present on Ganymede (110 kelvin) Delitsky, M. et al (1998) the tardigrades would probably enter into
                hibernation. Horikawa, D. (2011). <br></br>

                The magnetic field of Ganymede is one of the most unique things about it. However, it only has a field
                strength of 750 nT at the equator Kivelson, M. et al (2002), which is only 1/40th that of earth. Finlay,
                C. et al (2010) This makes it rather unlikely to make much of a difference to the radiation environment
                on
                the ground. Kivelson, M. et al (1996).
                Additionally, it should be noted that Ganymede's ocean is under 150 km of ice Pappalardo, R. et al
                (2004)
                which would no doubt provide a great deal of radiation protection of its own.

              <h3 class="sub-heading" style="text-align: left; width: 100%;">
                Ganymede, the third satellite moon of Jupiter, has the largest body of water in the solar system. It is
                the only moon known to have its own magnetosphere and the reason behind this magnetic force has been
                debated, there being two possibilities of the moon’s interior properties. The moon has a composition of
                three main layers. A metallic core, a band of rock surrounding the core also known as a mantle, icy
                shell
                and silicate rock. Ganymede is said to have a possible ‘club sandwich-like’ layer beneath the icy
                surface.
                This interaction of water and rock raises the possibility of a saltwater ocean beneath its surface.
                The other theory is that the core of Ganymede remains warm and liquid rather than a solid mass. The
                reason
                for that hypothesis is that the magnetic field around the moon might be a result of it. This theory was
                posed by Magaret Kivelson at NASA who worked as the principal investigator of the magnetometer on
                Galileo
                spacecraft. (Margaret, 2019). Galileo's trajectory to Ganymede indicated surfaces on the north poles
                that
                could be covered with water-ice frosts. (David, 2000).

                In Figure 1.1 and 1.2, there are two possibilities of the interior of Ganymede. Without any concrete
                evidence on the true composition of the moon’s interior, research should be conducted on not only the
                surface of Ganymede, but past the exterior layer.
                Researchers believed that high levels of atomic oxygen were responsible for the ultraviolet glow seen in
                images of Ganymede’s auroras. But when scientists Lorenz Roth and Nickolay Ivchenko analyzed the images
                more closely, they found very little atomic oxygen in Ganymede’s atmosphere. They also noticed that
                certain spectral lines did not disappear, even when the moon passed into Jupiter’s shadow. After further
                investigation, they discovered that these lines were actually due to water molecules evaporating from
                Ganymede’s icy surface. (Nickolay, 2021)
                <br></br>
                The lack of a probe or material/resource extractor on the JUICE mission sets back the understanding on
                interior properties of the moon. Factoring the time, distance constraints and inevitably the cost
                effects of launching such missions, the space exploration expectation of 2025-2050 would require a more
                adequate approach to moon explorations other than images, radiation measurements and atmosphere
                detections. (ESA, 2023).
                The proposed technologies below would create a better picture of what is usually expected of future

                The Laplace-P mission to Ganymede was designed to explore the Jovian system with both an orbiter and
                lander. By mapping the moon's surface, the LP1 orbiter could help pinpoint potential drilling sites by
                providing data on geological features like impact craters and variations in the icy crust’s structure
                (Laplace-P, 2017).
                Studies of Ganymede’s impact craters from previous missions (such as Voyager, Galileo, and Juno) suggest
                a stratified subsurface with distinct layers, including dark and bright ejecta blankets, that reveal
                information about the moon’s material composition. By understanding and combining the mapping data and
                crater analysis, the mission can enhance drilling accuracy and maximize the potential for uncovering
                evidence of life-supporting environments beneath Ganymede’s icy shell. (AGU, 2013)

                The atmosphere of Ganymede is very tenuous, mainly composed of O₂ and O, and with trace amounts of water
                vapor, and H₂O, which has been detected very recently by the Hubble Space Telescope. The superficial
                pressure is so low that the atmosphere may be compared to that of a vacuum, and it is hostile for all
                life as we know it.
              </h3>
              <h3 class="sub-heading" style="text-align: left; width: 100%;">
                In Figure 1.1 and 1.2, there are two possibilities of the interior of Ganymede. Without any concrete
                evidence on the true composition of the moon’s interior, research should be conducted on not only the
                surface of Ganymede, but past the exterior layer.
                Researchers believed that high levels of atomic oxygen were responsible for the ultraviolet glow seen in
                images of Ganymede’s auroras. But when scientists Lorenz Roth and Nickolay Ivchenko analyzed the images
                more closely, they found very little atomic oxygen in Ganymede’s atmosphere. They also noticed that
                certain spectral lines did not disappear, even when the moon passed into Jupiter’s shadow. After further
                investigation, they discovered that these lines were actually due to water molecules evaporating from
                Ganymede’s icy surface. (Nickolay, 2021)
                <br></br>
                The lack of a probe or material/resource extractor on the JUICE mission sets back the understanding on
                interior properties of the moon. Factoring the time, distance constraints and inevitably the cost
                effects of launching such missions, the space exploration expectation of 2025-2050 would require a more
                adequate approach to moon explorations other than images, radiation measurements and atmosphere
                detections. (ESA, 2023).
                The proposed technologies below would create a better picture of what is usually expected of future
                missions on subsurface. However, discussion on whether this is the most optimum way to proceed follows
                the next section.

                    The NASA spacecraft Galileo, between 1995 and 2003, was equipped with various tracked scientific
                    instruments during its exploration of Jupiter and its moons, especially Ganymede. The Solid-State
                    Imaging (SSI) Camera and Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) were key instruments that
                    provided notable imagery and surface composition information, such as water ice. The Magnetometer
                    indicated that Ganymede possessed a unique magnetic field, probably due to a plausible liquid
                    interior or subsurface ocean. Further instruments-PLS and EPD-revealed information on Ganymede's
                    interaction with Jupiter's magnetosphere. These discoveries provided compelling evidence for
                    geological activity on Ganymede and a chance at future habitability, thus laying the groundwork for

            Our proposed Ganymede exploration mission aims to deepen our understanding of this unique Jovian moon

            <br>
            <br>
            Orbital & Lander reconnaissance:
            There is a good science case for exploration in going to Ganymede with a lander - as there is not much else planned from orbit beyond JUICE.
            After we start to receive JUICE data ideally, and those from Europa and Enceladus, the lander with
            complementary instruments .
            As Ganymede’s surface is not properly mapped, it would need to have some sensibilities and autonomous/AI
            navigation for hazard mitigation - To first detect ideal landinsg sites, then advanced sensors to navigate
            towards good spots potentially by what is underneath the surface. 

            For this we could consider the capabilities and advancements made by India with landings and rover mobility,
            as demonstrated by Chandrayaan-3’s soft landing and Mangalyaan missions.
            <br><br>
            Subsurface exploration:


            The advanced Spectrometer was taken off the Laplace project with Russia, originally meant to be on JUICE when the former
            was cancelled. The GCMS (Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometer) in particular, among other instruments, can
            reveal a great deal about chemical composition of atmosphere and sub-surface with probes, revealing potential
            biomarkers and signatures.
            To investigate potential habitats and analyze ice-ocean interfaces for signs of life
            (Landing also makes experiments like the mass spectrometry much easier without a moving target, for eg).

            <br><br>
            Data relay and analysis:
            To enable comprehensive interpretation of findings.
            AI would also be involved in analyzing the data; perhaps on site.

            <br><br>
            These approaches would be more refined and relevant than drilling through layers of thick ice of 150 km+.

            In newer research very recently discussed - (*unpublished) -

            In continuing experiments, the search for amino acids, (amines), & nucleobases (+ fatty acids) would be the
            essential biomarkers.

            On simulated icy moon surface, with Jupiter’s unique radiation environment (Prof Bhala (Private
            Communication), Physical Research Laboratory, 2024) successfully synthesized Sulphur containing amino acids
            – essential for life!

            The team also found through JWST observations, an ammoniated molecule on Callisto.
            Hence the environments we are studying are very interesting and still teeming with undiscovered secrets.

                    Why Ganymede you may ask? When excited by the possibilities of Europa and Enceladus -- the obvious,
                    more immediate candidates for habitability studies.
                    In fact the prospects are unique - being not the conventional candidate, insight into Ganymede may
                    open doors to venture to different kinds of bodies and further solar system exploration in the
                    search for life.

          <h2>Planetary Protection<br></h2>
          <br><br>
          <h3 style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;">
            The investigation of the ocean beneath Ganymede’s surface places it as a significant aspect in the search
            for unknown life, while also identifying the critical issue of protecting the planet's characteristics.
            Planetary protection refers to the measures taken to prevent any contamination on our planet and other
            celestial bodies. Two classifications are identified in planetary protection: forward and backward
            contamination, and various international actions are being undertaken to manage this concern (ECSS, 2019).
            <br><br>
            The COSPAR guidelines for planetary protection classify space exploration missions based on the likelihood
            and impact of biological contamination. Scientific missions to icy worlds, like Ganymede, operate under the
            guidelines of Category III and Category IV protection standards (Doran et al., 2023). Maintaining the
            integrity of scientific pursuits requires a proactive approach to identifying and mitigating any possible
            contamination of the subsurface ocean or liquid water habitats. COSPAR emphasizes the importance of managing
            bioburden to reduce the likelihood of organisms persisting on spacecraft and potentially colonizing
            environments over the next millennium (ECSS, 2019).
            <br><br>
            The exploration of an unknown world which carries significant implications, which include dilemmas
            particularly when thinking about the undiscovered life forms that may inhabit the planet. Brettschneider
            (2023) argues that establishing ethical standards for missions in outer space is vital for recognizing the
            existence, independence, and values of alien entities. This action emphasizes the conservation of untouched
            ecosystems by conducting ethical research, which coincidentally strives to reduce human impact of an alien
            environment.
            <br><br>
            Alongside this, the Outer Space Treaty established in 1967 and the missions to Ganymede form a collective
            international commitment. In 2024, COSPAR will be renewed, introducing a methodology that can be tailored to
            fit the unique circumstances of each mission. This adaptable framework not only strives to preserve ethical
            norms but also fosters the development of scientific studies. The recent revision of COSPAR (COSPAR, 2024)
            emphasizes the importance of conserving extraterrestrial planetary ecosystems and aims to achieve a balance
            with rigorous scientific research methodologies.
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, the ECSS Standard highlights the importance of implementing safety measures during the
            exploration of Ganymede, underscores the need for sterilization, and outlines specific procedures aimed at
            minimizing bioburden. In scenarios where contact with terrestrial settings is likely, it becomes essential
            to focus on minimizing microbial contamination throughout planetary expeditions (ECSS, 2019).
            <br><br>
            The pursuit of missions to Ganymede brings to light both captivating research opportunities and critical
            discussions surrounding planetary protection and ethical responsibilities. Compliance with COSPAR and ECSS
            regulations holds significant importance for every task executed in the context of the Ganymede exploration.
